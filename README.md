# Week 2: Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script

## Report

For this pandas descriptive statistics script, I used the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries in python to read a “grade.xlsx” and calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation.
Then, I generated three plots as following.

- Mean: 76.94444444444444
- Median: 85.0
- Standard Deviation: 18.36641711869187
